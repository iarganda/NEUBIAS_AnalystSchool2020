## Abstract

Machine learning and more recently Deep Learning, have pushed the accuracy of algorithms to unseen limits, especially for perceptual problems such as the ones tackled by computer vision and image analysis. This workshop will cover the foundations of the field, the communities organized around it, and some important tools and resources to get started with these techniques. Some successful applications of machine learning in the field of bioimage analysis will be presented with hands-on that will cover how to use two of the most popular open-source approaches: Trainable Weka Segmentation and DeepImageJ.


## Software Installation
